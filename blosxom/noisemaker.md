One of my side projects is a little tool called Noisemaker. NoiseMaker is a utility that runs in the background and generates white noise over the computer's speakers to mask out distractions like the TV, phone, annoying co-workers, etc... If you need it, you need it badly...

It's available as a shareware program at <a href="http://www.icegiant.com/nmaker.shtml">Icegiant Software</a>
