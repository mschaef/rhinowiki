I've been meaning to write this for months... after switching to an
iPhone last October I have some thoughts on the transition away from
Windows Mobile. Most of my detailed comments are complaints, so before
I continue, it's worth saying that I do think the iPhone is the best
smart phone you can buy. It is, by far, the best answer the industry
has come up with for this class of device. That said, it's more fun
(and potentially useful) to complain:

<ul>

<li> <b>Touch Screen</b> - I remember shopping with my parents for a
car in the late 80's. One of the cars we looked at was a Buick Riveria
with a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Buick-TouchScreen-x.jpg">
touch screen in the center console</a>. It was cool, but since it lacked
tactile feedback, you had to be looking at it to use it. Flash forward 23
years, and you can replicate this experience in the palm of your hand,
for better or for worse.

<li> <b>'Ambient Information'</b> - The phone does a poor job of
making inforation ambiently available. To see your next appointment,
you need to open the Calendar unless the reminder has already
displayed. (This could go on the home page.) To be notified of a new
e-mail, you need to unlock the phone and look at the home page. (This
could be a LED on the case.) As notifications build up, they wind up
truncated and incomplete, presumably so they can fit in an
artificially small box on the screen.

<li> <b>Portrait/Landscape</b> - I wake up in the morning and want to
check e-mail before I get up.. I grab the phone off the nightstand,
look at the display, and it... switches to landscape mode. I'm driving
down the road and want to skip a track, so I grab the phone (eyes on
the road), put my finger in the general area where the 'forward'
button is, and it... switches to landscape mode. Landscape is useful
when you need it, and a usability menace when you don't. There needs
to be better control over when it engages and when it doesn't. (In
this case, physical buttons for skipping forward and backward among
tracks might be nice too... Buick ultimately dropped the touch screen
entirely, and modern cars with navigation tend to also offer physical
controls for key functions.)

<li> <b>e-Mail</b> - I have two e-mail accounts set up on my phone:
personal and business. It takes five taps to switch between them. A
unified view would be nice. (A list of the union of all inboxes,
color-coded by in-box). An easier way to pick an in-box would be
almost as nice.

<li> <b>Large e-mails</b> - By default, large e-mails are only
partially downloaded to the phone and there's a button at the bottom of
a one of these mails that lets you download the rest. Of course, once it
does, it then zips you back to the top of the mail, so you have to
manually scroll through the (remember, it's large) e-mail to get to where
you were reading. Argh.

<li> <b>Latency</b> - Maybe a 3GS would fix this, but the phone seems
very slow to change modes and update the display. I find myself
continually waiting split-seconds for the thing to animate the transition
from one display to the next. I'm asking a lot here, but I don't care...
I use the thing most waking hours of most days.

<li> <b>App Store Rejections</b> - This is a problem, it sucks for app
developers, and it won't matter to the success of the platform. The
vast majority of customers will never hear that Apple censored a
dictionary (!), and even if they did, it won't stop them from buying.
In the short term, my guess is that Apple will make whatever minimal
changes it needs to make to keep developers quiet <i>enough</i>, and
the iPhone will continue to do very well.  Phone buyers don't care
enough about choice, and App developers will tend to always want to
code for the platform where they have the best shot at making money,
which is currently the iPhone.  In the long term, my guess is that a
lot more of this content will wind up on mobile web sites than through
the store. After all, a website can be an icon on the home page, avoid
the risk of Apple's rejecton, and also get to run on Android, Pre, and
Windows Mobile.

<li> <b>App Store</b> - 25,000 applications on the site, and I might
look at 10 or 20 before deciding to make a purchase. The way the store
presents applications (controlled by Apple) has a huge impact on which
apps succeed and which apps fail. Even if the rejection problem
magically goes away, Apple still controls the horizontal and the
vertical. (A lot like Google's control over the fate of websites...)

<li> <b>Keyboard</b> - After ten months, it's still tedious and
error-prone for me. It works, but just. Apple should provide a
keyboard layout that works like a Blackberry (or even T9) and trades
off multiple letters per key in exchange for larger keys.

<li> <b>Industrial Design</b> - I love the way the phone looks and
feels, so I wrap it in a tacky add on case to 'protect it'. So does
most everybody else. Last I heard, good design was about making a
product that looks good <b>and</b> works well. The rampant sales of
cases implies to me that something is missing with the 'works well'
part of that equation.

</ul>

I do like the thing, and I wouldn't switch away, but it's far from
perfect. Let's hope it gets better.
