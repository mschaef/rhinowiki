I just saw <a

story</a> on <a 
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Oregon_Trail_(computer_game)"> 
Oregon Trail</a> over on <a href="http://www.slashdot.org">Slashdot</a>.
I was born in 1975, which puts me in grade school in the early 1980's, 
the prime time for these early <a href="http://apple2history.org/">Apple 
][</a> educational games. As much as I liked Oregon Trail, I liked 
<a href="http://www.warrenrobinett.com/rockysboots/">Rocky's Boots</a> 
even better. The basic premise of Rocky's Boots was that you had to use 
basic boolean logic circuits to build machines to solve particular tasks. 
You ran around a little maze using a very early 'point and click' style 
user interface to gather parts and put them together. Once you were done, 
you got to watch your creation do its thing. A fun little bit of trivia 
regarding Rocky's Boots is that it was developed by Warren Robinette, the 
creator of <a href="http://www.atari2600.com/">Atari 2600</a> <a 
href="http://www.warrenrobinett.com/adventure/index.html">Adventure</a>, 
including the famous, ego-driven <a

egg</a>.
