title: The Inspiron has arrived...

I haven't had as much time to play with it as I'd like, but the laptop
arrived today.  In the hour I've had it running, so far I'm quite impressed.
A couple quick thoughts:

<ul>
<li>I like the keyboard: nice and solid.  Since the layout is more like
 a Dell D600 than a D400 (what I have from work), there'll be a little
 getting used to it. The D400 layout puts page up and page down near the
 arrow keys, which I've gotten used to for reading documents. The I6000
 (and D600/D800) puts page up and page down up near the display. If
 that gets too obnoxious, I might have to investigate remapping some
 of the media keys on the front of the machine to more useful keys.
<li>I <b>love</b> the WUXGA (1900x1200, approx.) display.  The machine
  came from the factory with large icons
  enabled and set to 120dpi. Set up that way, it seems readable enough
  to me, but my vision is so far correctable to 20/20. If smaller
  text adds to fatigue or is harder to read on a bouncy train, it'll
  be possible to enlarge text through preferences, so I'm not worried
  about it at all. <i>At this point, the 1024x768 D400 is going to
  feel <b>very</b> cramped.</i>
<li>Dell still dumps its machines full of software.  This machine came
  with several broadband offers, four media players, and a bunch of
  modem stuff.  Most of that's getting uninstalled in the name of
  system stability. I already have broadband, I don't use streaming media
  that much, and I haven't used a modem in years.
<li>XP Media edition looks the same as XP Pro, so far.
</ul>
