title: Restaurant Nutritional Information, Part 2

A couple months ago, I speculated that <a href="http://www.mschaef.com/cgi-bin/my_blosxom.cgi/misc/restaurant_nutrition.txt"><i>
it seems reasonable for the FDA to mandate that restaurants make nutritional information easily available in the store, at the time 
of purchase</i></a>.  Oddly enough, at a McDonalds the other day, I noticed that they were printing FDA standard nutritional labels 
on the side of their food cartons. This is a trend that should continue, although if it's not enforced, it's pretty easy to see how 
Some place like <a href="http://www.hardees.com">Hardee's</a> might be reluctant to slap a 1,420 calorie label on the side of their 
<a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/6498304">Monster Thickburger</a>. It's pretty easy to believe that sales would plummet: with the 
label on, it'd be much harder to delude yourself about what you are eating.
