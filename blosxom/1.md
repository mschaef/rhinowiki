title: New Computer... Links from the old...

Tomorrow, my employer is replacing my three year old <a 
href="http://www.dell.com/downloads/us/products/latit/d400_spec.pdf">Dell 
D400</a> with a nice new <a 
href="http://h10010.www1.hp.com/wwpc/us/en/sm/WF06a/321957-321957-64295-321838-306995-1847110.html">Compaq 
nc2400</a>. I have to admit that I'm a bit apprehensive about the switch; My 
D400 works quite well and shows few signs of decay. But, I also remember 
feeling the same way about the D400. Maybe the Compaq will be as good as the 
<a href="http://oldcomputers.net/compaqi.html">last Compaq I regularly 
used</a> and be another nice suprise. Anyway, as part of clearing out the old 
machine, here are a few links I've found that I'd like to preserve.  No 
promises on content, but you might find at least one of them to be 
interesting if you read this blog.

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.nicholasgcarr.com/articles/matter.html"><b>Nicholas 
Carr - IT Doesn't Matter</b></a> - Probably false, from what I've heard about 
it.

<li><a href="http://www.folklore.org/index.py"><b>Folklore.org - Macintosh 
Stories</b></a> - Wonderful web site dedicated to stories from the creation of 
the Macintosh. If you're up for that, you might also be up for <a 
href="http://apple2history.org/">this</a>, a detailed history of the old Apple 
][ machines.


<li><a href="http://philip.greenspun.com/ancient-history/webmail/"><b>Design 
and Implementation of a Web-based Email System</b></a>

<li><a 
href="http://www.oracle.com/technology/documentation/index.html"><b>Oracle 
Documentation Home Page</b></a> - <a href="http://www.oracle.com">Oracle</a>'s 
website <a 
href="http://www.mschaef.com/blog/tech/general/oracle_and_their_website.txt">sucks</a>, 
so here is the link to their documentation that's not as obvious as it should 
be.

<li><a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/"><b>Y Combinator Startup 
News</b></a> - Elitist <a href="http://www.reddit.com">Reddit</a>.

<li><a href="http://blog.ruhlman.com/"><b>Michael Ruhlman's Blog</b></a> - 
Good for foodies. This is the guy that went to culinary school to learn enough 
about cooking to write about chefs.

<li><a 
href="http://www.sysco.com/products/productpage_search.asp?productID=329"><b>SmartServe 
Chicken</b></a> - The opposite of the last link, but you've probably eaten 
this crap if you live in the western world.

<li><a href="http://www.jagweb.com/jagworld/v12-engine/index.html"><b>Jaguar 
V12 Engine</b></a> - A nice history of an apparantly pretty troublesome, but 
'sexy', engine.

<li><a href="http://www.liegroups.org/"><b>Atlas of Lie Groups and 
Representations</b></a> - I have no idea what this is, but it seems important. 
:-)

on Programming in C</b></a>

<li><a href="http://www.fordsix.com/index.php"><b>Ford Six Performance</b></a> 
- Ford dropped this engine in favor of a 4.2 Liter V6, but this was the entry 
level truck engine for years. I remember very clearly looking at new 4.9 liter 
F-150's with my dad back in 1991.

<li><a href="http://www.bitsavers.org/"><b>Bitsavers</b></a> - This is 
probably the most important link on the list, aside from the next one. A huge 
archive of old computer documentation and software. If you're a computer geek, 
and you care about where you came from, you should click this link and spend 
the next couple weeks reading.
