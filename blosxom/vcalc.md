vCalc is the other side project I have going on right now. It's
a simple RPN style calculator written for Win32. Underlying
vCalc is a Scheme interpreter that I talk about a little
<a href="http://www.mschaef.com/inside_vcalc.html">here</a>.
The ultimate goal for vCalc is to have a calculator that can
be easily extended with Scheme functions, in addition to
the keystroke sequences you might expect. As it turns out,
there are a lot of interesting problems that crop up trying
to make this work right. I hope to blog more on this in
the future.
