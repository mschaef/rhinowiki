# Rhinowiki

This is a a simple blog engine I use for my
[personal website](https://mschaef.com).

The underlying store for both articles and static content is either a
local git repository or a local filesystrem. I use the local file
system when writing content on my laptop and push it to the server
using git. Articles themselves are represented in tagged markdown and
it can also serve images and other static content.

## Why "Rhinowiki"

Years ago, before server-side Javascript was a really a thing, I used
the Rhino Javascript engine to implement a a similar concept. Because
that earlier system had editable docuents, I referred to it as a
wiki. Hence the name "Rhinowiki".

While the current Rhinowiki has nothing in common with that earlier
program, I liked the name and stuck with it.
