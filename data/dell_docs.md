This is cool... I knew IBM (er, Lenovo) did <a
href="http://support.dell.com/support/systemsinfo/documentation.aspx?c=us&cs=555&l=en&s=biz">this</a>,
but Dell does it too.  They have an <a
href="http://support.dell.com/support/systemsinfo/documentation.aspx?c=us&cs=555&l=en&s=biz">online
site</a> with all of the service manuals and documentation for every
machine they've ever sold. This includes detailed instructions on
disassembling and rebuilding laptops.

Even more cool is that the archive goes back to the beginning, back when
Dell was called PC's Limited. 

<i>Note: The IBM link above is actually still on the IBM site... I expect the
link to break whenever Lenovo takes the contents.</i>
