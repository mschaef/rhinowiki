When diapering a little boy, it's a pretty common suggestion that you
take steps to prevent spurious pee from making too much of a
mess. What doesn't get said is that this applies for the other end
too.  For a breast feeding child, you need to be prepared for it to
happen at the least opportune moment and have a range of <i>over a
foot</i>.  I expect that this applies equally to either gender of
child.  Enough said.
