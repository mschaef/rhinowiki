<a href="http://www.sliver.com/dotnet/MessageDialog/">This</a> be
should part of the Win32 API if it's not already.  Basically, it
amounts to a variant of the MessageBox API that allows custom button
labels, rather than just "Yes", "No", "Abort", "Retry", etc.

Maybe this kind of API would have made abominations like this less likely:

At least users might be able to avoid calling errors "OK", of all things...
