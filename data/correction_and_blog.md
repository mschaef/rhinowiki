title: A correction and another blog.

* There was a copy/paste error in the version of <a href="http://www.mschaef.com/blog/tech/programming/ant-up.html">ant-up</a> 
  I posted a while ago. It has now been corrected.
* I ran across <a href="http://www.adamhoughton.com">Adam Houghton's
  blog</a> the other day. It looks pretty interesting and there's 
  software to download (which is more than I can say right now). The blog 
  seems to currently focus on Apple/Java/AJAX related content. The iPhone
  based javadoc viewer looks particularly interesting for those of us 
  not interested in carrying around a library.
* Also, on a totally different note is <a 
  href="http://www.autoblog.com/">Autoblog</a>, a 'professional' blog
  covering automotive news. It's updated fairly often too.
