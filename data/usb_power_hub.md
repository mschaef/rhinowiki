title: From USB port to battery charger...

I don't know how plausible it is, but it'd be awfully nice if laptops
had a way to power USB ports when the machine is off but plugged
in. Perhaps this could be controlled by a switch on the side of the
case that turns on USB power only.

The use case, of course, is for portable devices that can charge their
batteries over a USB connection. Apple has stopped bundling anything
except a USB cable with the iPod, and it's pretty easy to find USB
power cords for PDA's and cell phones. With this kind of functionality
in a laptop, the laptop could become a traveler's one central power
adapter, eliminating the need to carry large numbers of dedicated
adapters or half-baked partial solutions like the <a

extra for a laptop with this feature.

Another way this could be implemented would be to put 3-4 power-only
USB ports on the laptop's power brick.
