I took a look around my computer for information on the "DCOM Server Process Launcher" referred to in <a 
href="http://www.mschaef.com/cgi-bin/my_blosxom.cgi/tech/general/the_even_more_abominable_dialog_box.txt">this post</a>.  
Fortunately, Microsoft's services control panel has a place to put descriptive text.  The description for the "DCOM Server 
Process Launcher" reads "Provides Launch Functionality for DCOM Services".  Seriously.

Why even bother trying? A Microsoft PM documented this description
feature. A programmer coded it. A tester tested it. A writer wrote the
text. Another writer documented the feature. Translators translated it
into 60 different languages. All so that Windows could show a
description that is <b>exactly as useless as the name of the
service</b>.

The smallest disk Dell sells on their cheapest laptop is 40GB. Is it
really too much to ask for the description to include text closer to
this?

For bonus points, the service description would also be available from
the fault notification dialog box, possibly with hyperlinks to the
appropriate developer information on MSDN (which could also be stored
locally). The whole key here: trust the user of your product and
enable them to use it efficiently.
