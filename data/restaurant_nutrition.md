title: Restaurant Nutritional Information

No geek stuff today....

The FDA has done a good job of requiring packaged food to be labled with 
<a href="http://www.fda.gov/opacom/backgrounders/foodlabel/newlabel.html">
nutritional information</a>, but when you eat out, that food can fall through
the cracks. Some restaurants make solid attempts at making the information
available: Red Lobster actually puts nutritional information for selected
products right on the menu. However, even Red Lobster has limits: they only
list information for their LightHouse menu, their menu of lighter fare. Go
to their website, and you can see their <a href="http://www.redlobster.com/company/prfaq.asp">
position on the rest of their menu</a>: <i>"Since our chefs are continuously
creating and customizing recipes for our menu, we only have Red Lobster's
LightHouse menu information available online."</i>. That rings a little hollow
once you realize that dishes like their Crab Alfredo have been on the menu for
decades. Of course, what's really going on is that Red Lobster knows that
publishing information on the 2,000 calories (that's a guess) in a plate
of Crab Alfredo will kill their sales. After all, restaurants are supposed
to be a fun treat, not a tiptoe through a nuturitional minefield.

Like you'd expect, some restaurants are better than others. <a

(wonderful Americanized Chinese food, you should try it if you
haven't) does the ultimate: they put all of their <a
href="http://www.pfchangs.com/cuisine/menu_main.html"> nutritional
information</a> online. That's everything from the 56 calorie cup of
Hot and Sour soup to the 1,883 calorie "Great Wall of Chocolate".
Good show (even if it is buried beneath some inconvenient
JavaScript). <a href="http://www.mcdonalds.com/">McDonald's</a> is
also noteworthy: they have complete nutritional information available
in the store, before

Moving down a bit are restaurants like <a
href="http://www.jasonsdeli.com">Jason's Deli</a>. Jason's deli <a
href="http://www.jasonsdeli.com/nutrition.html">claims that <i>"We
provide our nutritional information in Adobe Acrobat .pdf
format."</i></a>.  However, once you open the PDF file, they ask you
to send a mail asking for each piece of nuturitional information
seperately. I don't know what their expectation is (do I really need
to list every nutritional variable for every menu item?), but the
evidence seems to indicate their closing the information up, rather
than making it more open. Another trick is on <a
href="http://www.firehousesubs.com/"> Firehouse Subs'</a> website.
They publish nutritional information, but they fail to include cheese
or mayo in their calorie counts (which are served by default) in their
table of figures. If you order a stock medium sandwhich and skim the
chart, you're liable to understimate the calorie count by 30-40%. In
fact, the only way you can get the total calorie count of a completely
dressed sandwich is to know that there are 9 calories per gram of fat.

I don't know what percentage of calories our country consumes comes
through restaurants, but I do know that it's been increasing for a
long time. As a result, it seems reasonable for the FDA to mandate
that restaurants make nutritional information easily available in the
store, at the time of purchase. To avoid too much adverse impact on
smaller restaurants, perhaps this could be means tested: restaurants
serving fewer than X people per day could be excluded, etc.  Either
way, I want to be able to know what I'm eating.
