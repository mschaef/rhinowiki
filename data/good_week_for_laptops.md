title: A good couple of weeks for laptops...

Sorry for the long delay between posts... it's been a busy couple of
months.

* <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OLPC">The "One Laptop Per Child" Prototype</a>
   This is the result of the famous $100 laptop project at MIT. It looks cheap, simple, and
   bulletproof. When the machine is closed, it's sealed well enough to tolerate rain and sand
   storms. The machine has also been designed with an unusual display that offers good contrast
   in sunlight and 200dpi resolution for reading electronic books. For developing countries,
   this seems like it's the most valuable use case: as a cheap way to dissemenate lots of
   textbooks and information to folks that would not otherwise have access. The display can
   also switch into a more conventional color mode for running Fedora Linux. To be frank, the
   unique attributes of these machines seem like they'd be useful to almost any laptop user.
   The OLPC laptop can be <a href="http://www.pledgebank.com/100laptop">pre-ordered in the US
   for $300</a>, triple-price: The extra money goes to fund two laptops for children in 
   the developing world.

     Dell D620.</a> I saw one of these in the Penn bookstore the other day and came away impressed.
     Not only did Dell do the usual CPU/chipset upgrades, they switched to a widescreeen
     display that'll work better in an airplane seat. Price seems pretty much the same as the
     older D610, so this looks like a pretty good value for a metal chassis 'professional' laptop.

   Samsung Q1-SSD</a> - This is the first laptop with a fully solid state disk: the usual rotating
   media has been replated with a 32GB flash drive. This quiets the machine down and provides
   good disk bandwidth for faster boot times. I'm also willing to bet that 'disk' access times
   are better by orders of magnitude. This is Korean-market-only right now, but this is hopefully
   a positive sign of things to come: 32GB is enough space to do lots of interesting things, and
   if this allows smaller, quieter, faster, lower-power computers, I can hardly wait.

    running Mac OS X with a Core Duo, and priced starting at $1099. This seems like a
    bargin.
