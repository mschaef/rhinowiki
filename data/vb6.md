There's been some 'controversy' in the blog world about a <a
href="http://classicvb.org/petition/">petition</a> that's circulating
to ask Microsoft to continue supporting "Classic" Visual BASIC in
addition to the replacement VB.Net. A month ago, I had a pretty long
post dedicated to the topic, but due to technical problems I wasn't
able to get it online.  Therefore, I'll keep this sweet and to the
point.

The core problem VB6 developers are facing is that they sank lots of
development money into a closed, one-vendor language. Choosing VB6
basically amounted to a gamble that Microsoft would continue to
support and develop the language for the duration of a project's
active life. That gamble hasn't paid off for some developers, and
companies with sizable investments in VB6 code now need to figure out
how to make the most of that investment while still evolving their
software.

With standardized languages like C, languages with multiple tool
vendors, the risk is significantly lower. If one vendor drops their
version of a language, switching to another implementation is going to
be a lot easier than porting to an entirely different platform
(particularly if you've avoiced or isolated vendor-specific features).

So... what's the moral of this story? Before you base your business on
a particular language or tool, make sure you know what happens if that
platform ever loses support. Pick something standardized, with
multiple viable vendors. Or alternatively pick something open source,
where you can take over platform development yourself (if you
absolutely need to).  Whatever you do, don't pick a one vendor tool
and complain when the vendor decides to drop it. <i>Commercial
vendors, particularly, have <b>no legal obligation</b> to their
customers.</i>
