title: Should blog posts be written like a newspaper article?

Should blog posts be written with the <a
href="http://www.freep.com/jobspage/academy/writing.htm"> essential
content at the beginning</a> and less interesting details at the end?
Or is <a
href="http://www.mschaef.com/cgi-bin/blosxom.cgi/2005/06/01#apple_pricing">putting
the punchline at the end</a> acceptable?

Since people <a href="http://www.useit.com/alertbox/9710a.html">tend
not to read online</a>, and blogs are often read in <a
href="http://scoble.weblogs.com/">huge volumes</a> via an <a
href="http://www.sharpreader.com/">aggregator</a>, my hunch is that
the title (and maybe the first paragraph) have to convince people your
article is worth the time...

More established bloggers, with a better track record of writing
interesting stuff, might have more leeway.
