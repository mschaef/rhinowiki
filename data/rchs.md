Where did Ryan's name come from? Lots of agonizing.  We didn't find
out Ryan's gender prior to his birth and for some reason it was easier
to pick the girl's name than the boy's name.  Anyway, here's the
etymology:

* <b>Ryan</b> -  We struggled with this one for months.  Ryan is 
  actually the name of a guy that Mike worked for for a week and
  also the last name of a painter we employed about the same time. It
  fell into our laps and we liked it.

* <b>Charles</b> - This is the first name of Charles Schaeffer, may he
  rest in peace.  Charles was Mike's paternal grandfather and he
  passed away around the time Mike was born. Charles was also a part of
  our wedding: Mike wore a pair of his cuff links as shirt buttons during
  the cermony.

* <b>Harrison</b> - Teresa's maiden name, and the name she uses for business purposes.

* <b>Schaeffer</b> - Mike's family name.
