There's a long running <a
href="http://research.microsoft.com/~daniel/unix-haters.html">joke</a>
about <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ken_Thompson_(computer_programmer)">Ken
Thompson</a>'s car. It goes something like this: 'Ken Thompson's car
replaces all the confusing gauges with one warning light -- the
experienced user will know what's wrong when the light goes on.'  Ryan
is just like that if you replace the 'one warning light' with
'one piercing cry'. 

The compensating factor for Ryan's lack of communications skills is
that babies don't need or want all that much. It basically boils down
to food, clean clothes and diaper, a comfortable enviroment, and some
companionship and cuddling. That makes an exhaustive search of all
possible 'error conditions' relatively brief.  It is frustrating at
times (1:00 in the morning and nothing seems to be working), but I
don't know if it'll end up more or less frustrating than 15-16 years
from now when he's asking for a new sports car or extended curfew.
