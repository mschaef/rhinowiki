Another useful blog from <a href="http://www.microsoft.com">Microsoft</a>.
<a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/michkap/">Michael Kaplan has been blogging</a>
for quite some time on internationalization and other Unicode-related issues.
His blog full of deep, technical information on a part of Windows that seems
to get overlooked a lot. I've been starting the very first steps of getting
vCalc (and my Scheme interpreter) to be Unicode aware, so his blog has been
timely reading.

I've also found, via <a href="http://lambda-the-ultimate.org/">Lambda the Ultimate</a>,
a website dedicated to  <a href="http://lambda-the-ultimate.org/node/view/553">Alexander
Stepanov's papers and code</a>. Stepanov is one of the principals behind the C++
STL (STepanov and Lee) Standard Template Library.
