title: Sleepers, Awake.

Now that the new year has begun, the holiday season lull in blog posts
has started to abate.  I had wondered if posts would go down in
frequency or up, since people had more time to dedicate to
'extracurricular' activities.  Now we (I?)  know.

The next interesting question is that since blog posts seem like they
might be inversely correlated with vacation time, is blogging actually
actively sponsored by employers?  That is, are there firms where a
high profile as a blogger will lead to things like good performance
reviews, raises, and good assignments?

Even at the most open minded, technically progressive firms I've
worked at, I am 100% positive that blogging activities would have been
considered a distant priority behind shipping and supporting
product. Maybe it's old fashioned of me to say it, but that seems like
the correct approach.
