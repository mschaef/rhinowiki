<p>
  A few more-or-less random observations about our industry, and various
  recent product releases:
</p>

<ul>
<li><b>Google Nexus 6</b> - Nice phone, but they lost one of the
  biggest competitive differentiators of the older 4 and 5 models:
  the price, and they did it with a more-niche phablet-sized device.
  Seems like a big mistake.</li>

<li><b>2015 MacBook</b> - Assuming they didn't screw up the keyboard
  too badly, Apple has something special here. Powerful enough to do
  what most people need, a Retina display, and highly portable. The
  single port seems like genius, in that it eliminates the need/desire
  for devices like the <a href="http://hengedocks.com/">Henge
  Dock</a>.  It'll also be interesting to see how many of the new
  MacBook design elements make it to the Pro and Air.</li>

<li><b>Apple Watch</b> - Another display to serve as a distraction,
  another battery to keep charged, and another device to maintain and
  upgrade? To me, the marginal benefit of carrying and maintaining the
  watch does not sufficiently offset the marginal costs. If it's more
  about style than function, then Apple has to make a compelling
  argument that the Edition watch is really worth 50 times the basic
  watch, despite the fact it's stylistically so similar.</li>
  
</ul>
