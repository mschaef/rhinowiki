title: Inspiron 6000d (and Laptop Shopping Advice)

I just placed an order for a Dell Inspiron 6000D, using one of
Dell's recent $750 off deals. With any luck, it'll ship in
a couple weeks. In the course of doing research on the
machine, I found  <a href="http://www.math.ucla.edu/~jimc/insp6000/">this
site</a> describing James Carter's experiences with the machine. It
is without a doubt the best, most comprehensive laptop review
I have ever seen. If you write a product review for a laptop computer, 
you should emulate this.

Something else worth mentioning is that laptop vendors typically
use standard parts in their hardware.  While they don't publicize
part numbers (partially so they can switch suppliers), it is possible
to find datasheets describing things like LCD panels. While it
takes some inference to figure out what part is being used, 
this can reveal statistics about LCD panels that might otherwise
be hard to find. While Google is your friend, <a href="http://www.eio.com/datashet.htm">
this site</a> has a bunch of links to useful datasheets.

PS: I've ordered the WUXGA (>2 Megapixels, ~140dpi) display with the
128MB Radeon X300 video adapter. If on screen content isn't too
small, I expect the detail to be fabulous.  I'll post comments
(and screenshots) when I get some experience with the machine.
