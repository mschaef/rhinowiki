Ryan's fuzzy pal, <a

monster.  From his smash hit, <a

the Mirror</a>:

> If your mirror has a monster in it, do not shout <br>
> This kind of situation does not call for freaking out <br>
> And do nothing that you would not like to see him do <br>
> Cause that monster in the mirror he just might be you"</i>
