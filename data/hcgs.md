true...</a> The biggest thing that keeps the blogosphere from being an
endless cesspool of 'happy critical guys' is that it explicitly forces
readers to seek out and subscribe to each individual blog. In
contrast, If you subscribe to a USENET newsgroup, the default behavior
is that you see posts from all the contributors to the group. You can
change this by explicitly killing threads or users, but, by default,
you see it all. That makes it easier for individuals to gain
readership, which arguably lowers quality.
