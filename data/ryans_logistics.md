title: A few logistical notes

With <a
href="http://www.mschaef.com/blog/personal/ryan_charles">Ryan</a>'s
arrival, my blog is going to start containing more non-techical
material.  To avoid forcing people into reading about the poopie
diapers and/or lexical closures they aren't interested in, I've
partitioned the blog into a couple of sub-feeds.  I've also started
using URL rewriting to remove the reference to <a
href="http://www.blosxom.com/">blosxom</a> from links to the weblog.
Links to this weblog should now look like this:
<tt>http://www.mschaef.com/blog/personal/ryan_charles</tt>.  The old
style links should work as long I continue using blosxom, but if that
ever changes they will start failing. (I'll try to put permanent
redirections in place to avoid too many problems with obsolete links.)
Without further ado, here are the good weblog links:

* <a href="http://www.mschaef.com/blog/">All content</a>
  (<a href="http://www.mschaef.com/blog/index.rss">RSS</a>)

* <a href="http://www.mschaef.com/blog/personal/">Personal content only</a>
  (<a href="http://www.mschaef.com/blog/personal/index.rss">RSS</a>)
  
* <a href="http://www.mschaef.com/blog/tech/">Technical content only</a>
  (<a href="http://www.mschaef.com/blog/tech/index.rss">RSS</a>)
