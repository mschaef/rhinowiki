Reading <a href="http://www.slashdot.org">Slashdot</a> today, I heard
that <a

Jef Raskin has passed away from cancer</a>. If you don't know who Jef
is, it's safe to say that you have been influenced by his ideas if
you're reading this blog.

Dr. Raskin was one of the first human interface experts to contribute to
and be involved in the <a href="http://www.apple.com">Apple Macintosh</a>.
computer.  While it's true that the design took a different direction from
some of his initial ideas, he played a major role in defining the user interface
ethic of the Macintosh, and consequently basically every other major computer
interface.

After leaving Apple, Jef went on to continue his ideas with the
SwyftCard and <a

Cat</a>.  The best articulation I've seen of his ideas regarding
interface design is in his book, <a

Humane Interface</a>. He has also put a great deal of his work on his

website</a>.

This is a sad day, indeed.
