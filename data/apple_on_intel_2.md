I didn't believe it was possible when I first heard the rumors a few
weeks ago, but <a href="http://biz.yahoo.com/prnews/050606/sfm142.html?.v=9">Here
it is</a>: Apple will transition to x86, specifically Intel, in 2006. The
whole line will go x86 in 2007. Microsoft is behind the switch, as
is Adobe. Interestingly, the developer transition kit has an Intel
compiler at its core. I wonder why not GCC.

The next question is how well it will be pulled off. In theory it could be
seamless. It needs to be.
