Ryan turned two weeks old the other day. In honor of the occasion we've put a 
few more pictures online in <a 
href="http://www.mschaef.com/albums/ryan_2_weeks/"> another album</a>. There's 
also good news to report about his two week checkup. Ryan lost the usual 
weight immediately after birth and has been steadily gaining weight since. 
Yesterday, his weight was 8 pounds 3 ounces. Based on that and his recent 
feeding behavior he's hit one of the initially expected growth spurts.  He 
also got a clean bill of health from the doctor otherwise.
