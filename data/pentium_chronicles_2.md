I finished <a
href="http://www.mschaef.com/cgi-bin/blosxom.cgi/tech/general/pentium_chronicles.txt">
Pentium Chronicles</a> on the train the other day. Given that the full
title of the book is <i>Pentium Chronicles: The People, Passion, and
Politics Behind Intel's Landmark Chips</i>, I have to say that I
expected something entirely different than I got. What I had thought
would be a narrative discussion of Intel's development of the P6 core
is really something else entirely: a book on large scale project
management techniques, using a few specific examples from the P6
project. While there's nothing wrong with that kind of book (it's
basically what <a href="http://www.cs.unc.edu/~brooks/">Fred
Brooks</a> did with <a
href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0201835959/103-2221210-9905457?v=glance&n=283155">The
Mythical Man Month</a>.), Dr. Colwell seems more tentatitve when he
decided what kind of book to write.

Early on in the preface, he basically announces his tentativeness when
he explicitly states that he won't be offering many of his opinions
because it stretches his "plausibile deniability" safety net too
far. To me, that's emblematic of the biggest shortcoming of the book
as an engineering/project management reference. Engineers working with
their own "Plausible deniability" in mind don't produce good results:
they work to redirect blame rather than improve the product they're
working on.  Dr. Colwell knows this, he even wrote about it in the
book. With all that in mind, I can't help but wonder what the book
would have been like if it had been written less with plausible
deniability in mind.

For people reading this blog who are wondering if they should actually
read the book, my answer is yes. However, it's important to go into
the book with the right expectations. If you go in expecting something
like <a
href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0316491977/103-2221210-9905457?v=glance&n=283155"><i>Soul
of a New Machine</i></a>, you'll be disappointed.
