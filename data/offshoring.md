title: Outsourcing vs. Offshoring

I'm writing some content for a future post on the offshoring of jobs
overseas, but I want to clear something up before it gets posted:
Outsourcing and offshoring are two different and orthogonal
concepts. This seems to be something that gets misunderstood a great
deal, but simply put, <b>outsourcing</b> is the movement of jobs to a
different <i>company</i> and <b>offshoring</b> is the movement of jobs
to a different <i>country</i>. Either one can be done without the
other.

The scenarios that people tend to get upset about (at least in the
United States) are the scenarios involving offshoring, the movement of
work overseas.  Outsourcing, however, does not necessarily imply that
the work gets moved to a different country: it's very common for work
to be outsourced to another American business employing American
workers. An example of this is hiring a Madison Avenue firm to put
together an ad campaign. Sure, it'd be possible to develop the talent
in house to do this yourself, but there are many advantages in
outsourcing the work to a more specialized vendor.
