title: The "Star of the American Road"

Oddly enough, the search term that brings the most visitors to my
little website is "Texaco". I suspect most of those people go away
totally unsatisfied, but there is a decent story behind the
connection:

About ten years ago, a good friend of mine went to work in Texaco's IT
Shop as a summer intern.  One of his job responsibilities was to
develop an intranet website. I forget the details, but somewhere along
the way he decided he wanted to put a fancy banner picture atop the
page.  At the time, we were both interested in ray tracing, so we
decided to throw together a raytraced version of the Texaco Star logo.

Using our copious free time, we found an online copy of the Texaco
logo, took measurements of the star and rendered it as a white solid
set against a metallic red hemisphere. We even went to the trouble of
animating the star so it rotates, generating a bunch of frames and
using a GIF tool to put together an animated GIF. The final result was
a nicely animated Texaco logo with an "attractive" (This is by 1995
intranet standards, remember) banner to the side.  Since then, I've
dragged the model out, re-rendered it at higher resolution, and stuck
it in a little <a

have set up.

For some reason, that picture brings more visitors to this site than
anything else. If you happen across this site and actually use the
image for something you owe its presence to a ten year old accident of
fate.
