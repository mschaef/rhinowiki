title: The End of an Era...

Nikon has just announced its intent to discontinue production of most
of its non-Digital cameras. In a digital world, this isn't too
suprising, but for someone who grew up with Nikon film cameras, it's a
bittersweet thing.

One notable thing about the announcement is that it also includes
lenses for large format cameras and enlargers. These are both low
volume but highly significant markets. Large format cameras are view
cameras, cameras that offer incredible control over perspective as
well as the ability to use very large film for very high resolution. A
large format camera might have 80 times the negative size of a 35mm
SLR: in digital terms that is roughly equivalent to 80 times the
number of pixels. Large format cameras are what <a

the very highest performance film cameras. If there was one area where
film was likely to offer unique value over digital, this was it.
