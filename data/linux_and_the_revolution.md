title: 2 Months With the 'Revolution'.

It's been about two months since I've installed Ubuntu Linux on my
Dell Inspiron 6000 laptop. The <a
href="http://www.mschaef.com/blog/tech/linux/long_road_to_linux.txt">initial
impression</a> was highly positive, but two months later the reality
is starting to wear a little thin. After switching to Ubuntu Linux my
laptop is slower, less media-savvy, uglier, and less compatible than
it was before. The thing that is sad about this is that as much as
Linux has improved, it feels like it is lagging behind Windows more
than it did ten years ago (the last time I used Linux full-time).

In a way, this relative lag is not too suprising; It is caused by the
convergance of two sets of industry trends over the last ten
years. Ten years ago, the commonplace Windows was Windows 95, based on
the old 16-bit Windows 3.x kernel; In 2006 the commonplace Windows is
Windows XP, based on the much more robust Windows NT kernel.  Ten
years ago, 3D graphics, video playback, and the Internet were only
beginning to emerge in the mainstream; In 2006, these applications
define the mainstream. Linux's kernel might still be better than
Windows, but it's less better now than it was ten years ago, eroding
its relative advantage. At the same time Linux's advantage in kernel
technology has been eroded, computers are increasingly used for things
that essentially require access to propriatary content and
technolgy. The Microsoft windows license fee pays for things like high
quality fonts, licences for MP3 and DVD CODEC's, and sophisiticated 3D
hardware support. It is either difficult or impossible to replace
these things in an open source model, so, to the extent they are
becoming more important, Linux increasingly suffers in contrast to its
closed course, license-for-fee competition.

One example of how this might directly impact people is MP3
playback. MP3 playback is built into Windows: the Windows licence fee
enables Microsoft to pay the <a
href="http://www.iis.fraunhofer.de/amm/download/index.html">Fraunhofer
institute</a>'s license fee for the MP3 patent. in contrast, MP3
playback is deliberately excluded from Ubuntu Linux because it's
patented and, despite the fact that <a
href="http://www.fluendo.com/">Fluendo</a> has paid for a patent
licence and written a GStreamer CODEC, the CODEC is not open source
and doesn't match Ubuntu's licensing model. Thus, while it is possible
to add MP3 support to Ubuntu Linux, it takes the extra step of
downloading and installing a CODEC.  The same is true for DVD and MPEG
video, not to mention that it will be true for Blu-Ray and HD-DVD
(assuming the protection mechanisms on those two are ever broken,
which has its own ironies).

What is key to realize about this situation is that it is as intrinsic
to the open source model as it is to the closed source model.  Open
source software precludes payment of license fees, closed source
requires it; Open source software precludes enforcement of trade
secrets, closed source enables it. Neither of these models is
necessarily 'wrong', but as our computational lives become more
dependant on technology that requires license fees or technolgy
protected by trade secrecy, open source will comparatively suffer more
and more. No amount of prosletyzing on the benefits of Open source
software will change either this fact or the moral right of those who
invest their blood, sweat, and tears into propriatary technology to
demand payment for their efforts.  The best that advocates of openness
can do is to act as revolutionaries by living the cause, advocating
its values, and hoping that enough people follow their lead to build a
critical mass.

However, like other 'revolutions', the Linux/Open source software
cause isn't necessarily an easy cause to live.  As I've been finding
out once more, the switch to Linux is a sometimes painful struggle
through mediocre software, bad asthetics, poor integration, and steep
learning curves. The question I'm struggling with right now is is it
even worth it?  The older I get and the more external responsibilities
I have, computers seem more and more like a tool for life and less and
less like a way of life. The 5-10 hours a week I spent maintaining and
integrating my Linux machines back in college is a much higher price
to pay now than it was then. No matter how much I might like for my
son to live in a world of free, open information and powerful free
software, it would be very difficult to justify taking enough time
away from him and my wife to make a useful contribution to the fight
to make it happen.  This is particulaly true if fighting the open
source fight somehow comprimises my actual paying job, which is
definately possible. I work for a Windows shop, and my management
could give a rat's ass about the theoretical benefits of open source
if it compromises my ability to serve our clients. One flubbed
presentation due to a flaky Linux installation could do just that, and
it would be very hard to use the benefits of Linux to explain it away
to the folks to whom I sell my time. Maybe the upshot of this is that
Linux is, like other revolutions, a young person's battle. However,
unlike other revolutions, Linux requires direct participation to reap
the benefits; If you aren't using open software, you're still at the
mercy of closed software vendors. If this is really the case, and
Linux really is for the 'young', then when will it ever become
relevant to the broader audience of Windows and Mac OS X users? I just
don't know. I will keep up the struggle for a while longer, January
2007 seems like a good time to reassess.
