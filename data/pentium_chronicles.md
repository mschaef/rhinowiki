I was roaming through the computer section of the University of
Pennsylvania bookstore and ran across <a
href="http://www.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-0471736171.html">
Pentium Chronicles</a>, a 2006 book talking about experiences
designing the P6 processor core used in the Pentium Pro, II, III, and
Centrino. The author, Robert P. Collwell, was basically made employee
number 1 on the P6 program when he was hired into Intel and given the
assignment to "double the performance of the P5 on the same process."
Of course, now, 15 years after that fateful assignment, it's pretty
clear how influential the design produced by that program has been: it
gave Intel a presence in the server and workstation markets, and it's
still overshadowing its immediate sucessor, the Pentium4. Even if the
project hadn't been that successful, the first 20% of Dr. Collwell's
book has me convinved that it'd have been an interesting read anyway.

At the opposite end of the spectrum is Kerry Nietz's book, <a
href="http://www.nietz.com/"> FoxTales</a>.  As much as <i>Pentium
Chronicles</i> was the view from the top, the perspective of a very
senior architect at Intel on a huge, industry-wide project,
<i>FoxTales</i> is the opposite: the perspective of a fresh out of
school programmer working on his first niche market shrink wrapped
software package. If anything, that means it's much more likely to be
relevant to people with the time to read this blog: it certainly
brought back memories of the first years of my career.

The best thing about both of these books is that they are both cheap
and short. You can probably read them both for <$50 and 10-20 hours of
time, all of which would be well spent.
