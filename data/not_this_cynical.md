If you don't know who <a
href="http://blogs.law.harvard.edu/dave/">Dave Winer</a> is, he
pioneered the development of <a
href="http://www.outliners.com/">outlining software</a> back in the
80's, developed one of the first system scripting tools for the
Macintosh, invented <a
href="http://www.xmlrpc.com/stories/storyReader$555">XML-RPC</a>, and
invented the <a href="http://blogs.law.harvard.edu/tech/rss">RSS
specification</a> you're probably using to read this blog post. I'm
not trying to belittle this guy's point of view, but he's been
responsible for developing several major pieces of consumer
application software, designed a couple hugely significant internet
procotols, and <a
href="http://www.kottke.org/05/10/weblogscom-sold-to-verisign">made
some signficant money in the process</a>. Most people should be so
lucky.
