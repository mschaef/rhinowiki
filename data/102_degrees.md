Ryan came down with a significant fever last night.  Due to measurement 
'complexities', it's hard to know for sure what the exact number is, but I 
don't think the exact number matters all that much to Ryan. His 
temperature is high enough the doctor wanted to see him, but not high 
enough that the doctor wanted to see him **NOW**. So, we're now waiting 
for the call back from the Doctor's office to schedule something for 
today, hopefully as early as possible. Despite his fever, Ryan seems to be 
doing relatively okay: when he's awake, he's not too far away from normal, 
smiling, happy Ryan.

While walking him to sleep last night, Daddy came up with a few new lyrics 
to 'Hush Little Baby':

> Sick little baby, go ahead and cry<br>
> You feel bad, and you don't know why<br>
> Even though you don't know what to do<br>
> You should know your Mom and Dad love you.

**Update:** Two minutes after my initial post, we just got an 
appointment in half an hour. One of the things I love about where we live 
is that we're five minutes away from the pediatrician.
