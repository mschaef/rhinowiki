Intel has released <a

of test chips made with its new 45 nanometer process</a>. For those of
you keeping score at home, that means it has transitors 4-5,000 times
smaller than those on the original 8088.  Look at it another way: the
30,000 transistors used in that old chip can now be made to fit in the
same space as 6 of the transistors actually used.

45 nanometer is apparently the second generation of <a

Lithography</a>, which <i>"has its roots in the proven technology of
immersion microscopy"</i>. My grandfather used oil immersion lenses on
his optical microscope (he was a <a

to step up the magnification to x2-3,000.
