title: New York Laundromat

Over the last several months, I've been spending a great deal of time
in New York City on business. In that time, I have never been quite
as suprised by prices as I have tonight. I wasn't even trying to
do anything all that unusual, just two loads of laundry.

Normally, I'd expect that two loads of laundry would cost about $6.
The washer would be $1.50 or so per run, and the dryer would be another
$1.50 per run, for a total of $6. Maybe even $7.50, if you decide to
run a second dryer cycle. Even in New York (west Midtown Manhattan),
I've been in apartments recently that charge about that much.

However, this apartment is special: they use a <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smart_card"> "smart" card</a>
system to manage payments. There's a dispenser on the side of the wall
that sells $7 cards for $10 (cards themselves cost $3). The dispenser
also allows you to reload cards in $5 and $10 increments. Once you
have a card, there are slots in each of the washers and dryers that
accept the card and debit from it the $2.50 it takes to buy a cycle in
one of the machines. Yes, you read that right: <b>$2.50</b>.  $2.50 in
my apartment complex buys a 34 minute washer cycle or a 30 (yes, 30)
minute dryer cycle.

So tonight, I spent $15 (200% of my estimate) and got this:

* A $3 "smart" Card to carry around and not lose

* Two complete loads of laundry that will inevitably end up damp,
  thanks to the pathetic dryer cycle.

* $2 of "change" on my "smart" card that I will <b>never</b> get to
  spend. (Since every machine in the laundromat costs $2.50, and the
  card can only be reloaded with $5 or $10)

The part of this that bothers me the most is the $3 surcharge on the
smart card.  Thanks to the pricing structure of the laundromat, the $3
surcharge really amounts to a $5 surcharge.  This means that someone
was either stupid enough not to notice that customers would always end
up with $2 of useless change, or was malicious enough to use this as a
sleazy way to bilk customers out of an extra $2. Not to mention that I
get the hassle of trying not to lose this stupid card, lest I want to
drop another $5 on yet another card.
